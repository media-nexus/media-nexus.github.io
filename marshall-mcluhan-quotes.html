		quotes.push('"All media work us over completely. They are so pervasive in their personal, political, economic, aesthetic, psychological, moral, ethical, and social consequences that they leave no part of us untouched, unaffected, unaltered. The medium is the message. Any understanding of social and cultural change is impossible without a knowledge of the way media work as environments. All media are extensions of some human faculty - psychic or physical."');
		 
		quotes.push('"The new is always made up of the old, or rather, what people see in the new is always the old thing. The rear-view mirror. The future of the future is the present, and this is something that people are terrified of."');

		quotes.push('"It is the framework which changes with each new technology and not just the picture within the frame."');
		
		quotes.push('"Every society honors its live conformists and its dead troublemakers."');
		
		quotes.push('"A point of view can be a dangerous luxury when substituted for insight and understanding."');

		quotes.push('"American youth attributes much more importance to arriving at driver`s license age than at voting age."');
		
		quotes.push('"One thing about which fish know exactly nothing is water, since they have no anti-environment which would enable them to perceive the element they live in."');
		
		quotes.push('"Once you see the boundaries of your environment, they are no longer the boundaries of your environment."');
		
		quotes.push('"Politics will eventually be replaced by imagery. The politician will be only too happy to abdicate in favor of his image, because the image will be much more powerful than he could ever be."');
		
		quotes.push('"The poet, the artist, the sleuth - whoever sharpens our perception tends to be antisocial; rarely "well-adjusted", he cannot go along with currents and trends. A strange bond often exists between antisocial types in their power to see environments as they really are. This need to interface, to confront environments with a certain antisocial power is manifest in the famous story "The Emperor`s New Clothes."');
		
		quotes.push('"Diaper spelled backwards is repaid , think about it."');
		
		quotes.push('"I am resolutely opposed to all innovation, all change, but I am determined to understand what’s happening. Because I don’t choose just to sit and let the juggernaut roll over me. Many people seem to think that if you talk about something recent, you’re in favor of it. The exact opposite is true in my case. Anything I talk about is almost certainly something I’m resolutely against. And it seems to me the best way to oppose it is to understand it. And then you know where to turn off the buttons."');
		
		quotes.push('"The greatest discovery of the 21st century will be the discovery that Man was not meant to live at the speed of light."');
		
		quotes.push('"they will be hearers of many things and will have learned nothing; they will appear to be omniscient and will generally know nothing;"');
		
		quotes.push('"if it works it`s obsolete"');
		
		quotes.push('"Advertisements constitute the only `good news` in the newspaper."');
		
		quotes.push('"Tranquilizers and anesthetics, private and corporate, become the largest business in the world just as the world is attempting to maximize every form of alert."');
		
		quotes.push('"Sound-light shows, as new cliché, are in effect mergers, retrievers of the tribal condition. It is a state that has already overtaken private enterprise, as individual businesses form into massive conglomerates. As information itself becomes the largest business in the world, data banks know more about individual people than the people do themselves. The more the data banks record about each one of us, the less we exist."');
				
		quotes.push('"The student of media soon comes to expect the New Media of any period whatever to be classed as `pseudo` by those who acquired the patterns of earlier media, whatever they may happen to be."');
		
		quotes.push('"Until writing was invented, man lived in an acoustic space: boundless, directionless, horizonless, in the dark of the mind, in the world of emotion, by primordial intuition, by terror. Speech is a social chart of this bog."');
		
		quotes.push('"Today`s child is growing up absurd, because he lives in two worlds, and neither of them inclines him to grow up."');
		
		quotes.push('"The job of art is not to store moments of experience but to explore environments that are otherwise invisible. Art is not a retrieval system of precious moments of past cultures. Art has a live, ongoing function."');
		
		quotes.push('"The artist is a person who is expert in the training of perception."');
		
		quotes.push('"The visible world is no longer a reality and the unseen world is no longer a dream"');
		
		quotes.push('"Rationality or consciousness is itself a ratio or proportion among the sensuous components of experience, and is not something added to such sense experience. Subrational beings have no means of achieving such a ratio or proportion in their sense lives but are wired for fixed wave lengths, as it were, having infallibility in their own area of experience. Consciousness, complex and subtle, can be impaired or ended by a mere stepping-up or dimming-down of any one sense intensity, which is the procedure in hypnosis. And the intensification of one sense by a new medium can hypnotize an entire community."');
		
		quotes.push('"Politics offers yesterday`s answers to today`s questions."');
		
		quotes.push('"Once we have surrendered our senses and nervous systems to the private manipulation of those who would try to benefit from taking a lease on our eyes and ears and nerves, we don`t really have any rights left."');
		
		quotes.push('"World War 3 is a guerrilla information war with no division between military and civilian participation."');
		
		quotes.push('"Humor as a system of communications and as a probe of our environment—of what`s really going on—affords us our most appealing anti-environmental tool. It does not deal in theory, but in immediate experience, and is often the best guide to changing perceptions."');
		
		quotes.push('"they will be tiresome company, having the show of wisdom without the reality."');
		
		quotes.push('"Only puny secrets need protection. Big discoveries are protected by public incredulity."');
		
		quotes.push('"By the way, goals and objectives are meaningless at the speed of light. At the speed of light, you aren’t going somewhere, you’re already there. On the telephone you’re not going somewhere, you’re there. And in the electronic world, going somewhere, you’re there. And in the electronic world, there are no goals or objectives, we’re already there."');
		
		quotes.push('"The more the data banks record about each one of us, the less we exist."');
		
		quotes.push('"Innumerable confusions and a profound feeling of despair invariably emerge in periods of great technological and cultural transitions. Our `Age of Anxiety` is, in great part, the result of trying to do today`s job with yesterday`s tools—with yesterday`s concepts."');
		
		quotes.push('"The constant broadcast and reception of ghostly images via radio and television, according to this notion, had weakened the sense, particularly among youth, of possessing the physical sense, particularly among youth, of possessing physical bodies and private identities."');
		
		quotes.push('"Our electrically-configured world has forced us to move from the habit of data classification to the mode of pattern recognition."');
		
		quotes.push('"The misleading effect of books like George Orwell`s 1984 is to project into the future a state of affairs that already exists."');
		
		quotes.push('"The formula for this brand of `historical` writing is to put the public on the inside; to let them feel the palpitations of royal and imperial lovers and to overhear their lispings and cooings. It can be argued that a man has to live somewhere, and that if his own time is so cut up by rapid change that he can`t find a cranny big enough to relax in, then he must betake himself to the past. [...] But mainly this formula works as a means of flattery. The public is not only invited inside but encouraged to believe that there is nothing inside that differs from its own thoughts and feelings. This reassurance is provided by endowing historical figures with the sloppiest possible minds. The great are `humanized` by being trivial."');
		
		quotes.push('"The debunking school began by making the great appear as corrupt, or mean and egotistical. The `humanizers` have merely carried on to make them idiotic. `Democratic` vanity has reached such proportions that it cannot accept as human anything above the level of cretinous confusion of mind of the type popularized by Hemingway`s heroes. Just as the new star must be made to appear successful by reason of some freak of fortune, so the great, past or present, must be made to seem so because of the most ordinary qualities, to which fortune adds an unearned trick or idea."');
		
		quotes.push('"In the age of instant information man ends his job of fragmented specializing and assumes the role of information-gathering. Today information-gathering resumes the inclusive concept of `culture` exactly as the primitive food-gatherer worked in complete equilibrium with his entire environment. Our quarry now, in this new nomadic and `workless` world, is knowledge and insight into the creative processes of life and society."');
		
		quotes.push('"Thus, as passivity becomes extreme in the bulk of society, a sizeable segment of citizens detaches itself from the dream-locked majority. As vulgarity and stupidity thicken, more and more people awaken to the intolerability of their condition. Much can be done to foster this state of awareness, even though little can be done directly to change the policies of those in control today of the media of communication."');
		
		quotes.push('"Professionalism is environmental. Amateurism is anti-environmental. Professionalism merges the individual into patterns of total environment. Amateurism seeks the development of the total awareness of the individual and the critical awareness of the groundrules of society. The amateur can afford to lose. The professional tends to classify and to specialize, to accept uncritically the groundrules of the environment. The groundrules provided by the mass response of his colleagues serve as a pervasive environment of which is is contentedly and unaware. The `expert` is the man who stays put."');
		
		quotes.push('"I satirize at all times, and my hyperboles are as nothing compared to the events to which they refer."');
		
		quotes.push('"Moral indignation is a technique used to endow the idiot with dignity."');
		
		quotes.push('"An understanding of media`s effects constitutes a civil defense against media fallout"');
